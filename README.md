# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This project was to assist with the concerns expressed by the school board of academic dishonecty reported for the scores for 9th grade students at Thomas High School.  The goal was to be able to analyze the data for the schools in a disctrict without any affect by the untrue scores.  To best move forward all of the "math"
 and "reading" scores in question for 9th graders at Thomas High School were removed.  With this new baseline, we were able create dataframes to analyze the updated data.  We were able to format the dat so we could provide the schoold board with the budget analysis, the comparison of averages passing scores for each school and spending ranges by school.  Overall taking out the faulty scores, gave a clear and more honest picture of how each school in the disctrict performed overall.

## Summary
I find that the updated changes made to  this data would in fact benefit the distric now and for future projections.  Having data that is not sckewed by known flaws or falicies is better for their long term goals and projections.  Having the false scores removed has helped the school counsel review the schools with the highest overall perfomance scores.  But also it allows to better compare on a grade level or by each school how the students performed in both math and reading.
